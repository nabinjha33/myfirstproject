# Fix Admin Settings Database Issue

## Problem
The admin settings page was showing "successfully saved" but not actually saving to the database because:
1. The `site_settings` table was missing several required columns
2. The save function was only simulating the API call

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed the admin settings page** to actually save to the database
2. **Created database migration** to add missing columns
3. **Enhanced SiteSettingsService** with proper update method

## Required Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration
Execute this SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of: database/add-missing-site-settings-columns.sql
```

Or run it via command line if you have psql access:
```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f database/add-missing-site-settings-columns.sql
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
1. Go to Admin Settings page
2. Make some changes to the settings
3. Click "Save All Settings"
4. Refresh the page - your changes should persist
5. Check the browser console for success logs

### 3. Check Database
In Supabase dashboard, verify the `site_settings` table now has these columns:
- `whatsapp_number`
- `default_theme`
- `default_language`
- `enable_dealer_notifications`
- `enable_inquiry_notifications`
- `enable_whatsapp_notifications`
- `auto_approve_dealers`

## Files Modified
- `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Fixed to load and save real data
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added `updateSettings()` method
- `src/lib/entities/index.ts` - Updated to use new method
- `database/add-missing-site-settings-columns.sql` - Migration script

## What Changed
- ✅ Settings now load from database on page load
- ✅ Settings actually save to database (not just simulation)
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Added loading states
- ✅ All form fields now map to database columns
- ✅ RLS is already disabled for development (as confirmed)

The admin settings should now work properly and persist changes to the database.
